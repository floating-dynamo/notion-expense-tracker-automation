# Notion Expense Tracker Automation

## Overview ℹ️
This project simplifies expense tracking by automating everything from pulling data to organizing and sharing it. It works by extracting data from JSON files, storing it in a Google Sheet, and syncing it with a Notion database. Plus, it even integrates with Slack, making sure the expense info is always up-to-date and easy to access.
